>"Working effeciently every changing moment." 

A beautiful quote of time and change in the nature of things.
Everything that changes from the being's observable universe to the unthinkable and unknown
a seemly unending journey of becoming.

Choice is importent for the manifested matter. [ANY NON-OBERVABLE & OBSERVABLE].
